## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Exercise 1-1:** `Hello, World!`  
   Run the **hello, world** program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program to see the error messages.

2. **Exercise 1-2:** Escape Characters  
   Experiment with what happens when a string in `print` contains `\c` where `c` is not a standard escape character.

## 🧮 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

3. **Exercise 1-3:** Temperature Table Heading  
   Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.

4. **Exercise 1-4:** Celsius → Fahrenheit Table  
   Write a program to print a Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion table.

5. **Exercise 1-5:** Reverse Temperature Table  
   Modify the program to print the table from **300°C to 0°C**.

## 🔤 Character Input and Output

6. **Exercise 1-6:** Verify EOF Expression  
   Verify that the expression `getchar() != EOF` evaluates to `0` or `1`.

7. **Exercise 1-7:** Print EOF Value  
   Write a program to print the value of `EOF`.

8. **Exercise 1-8:** Count Characters  
   Write a program to count **blanks, tabs, and newlines**.

9. **Exercise 1-9:** Reduce Multiple Blanks  
   Copy input to output, replacing each string of **one or more blanks** by a single blank.

10. **Exercise 1-10:** Show Tabs, Backspaces, and Backslashes  
    Copy input to output, making tabs (`\t`), backspaces (`\b`), and backslashes (`\\`) visible.

11. **Exercise 1-11:** Test Word Count  
    How would you test a word count program? Consider inputs that might uncover bugs.

12. **Exercise 1-12:** One Word Per Line  
    Write a program to print each word of input on a new line.

## 📊 Arrays

13. **Exercise 1-13:** Histogram of Word Lengths  
    Print a **horizontal histogram** of the lengths of words in input.  
    *(Vertical histogram is optional but challenging.)*

14. **Exercise 1-14:** Histogram of Character Frequencies  
    Print a histogram showing **frequencies of each character** in input.

## 🛠 Functions

15. **Exercise 1-15:** Function-Based Temperature Conversion  
    Rewrite the temperature conversion program using a **function** for conversion.

---

## 🔡 Character Arrays

16. **Exercise 1-16:** Longest Line  
    Modify the main routine to print the **length of arbitrarily long input lines** and as much text as possible.

17. **Exercise 1-17:** Lines Longer Than 80 Characters  
    Print all lines that exceed 80 characters.

18. **Exercise 1-18:** Remove Trailing Spaces  
    Remove trailing **blanks and tabs** and delete entirely blank lines.

19. **Exercise 1-19:** Reverse Lines  
    Write a function `reverse(s)` to reverse a string. Use it to reverse input **line by line**.

## 🌐 External Variables and Scope

20. **Exercise 1-20:** `detab` Program  
    Replace tabs in input with **spaces** to align to the next tab stop.  
    Decide whether `n` (tab width) should be a variable or a symbolic constant.

21. **Exercise 1-21:** `entab` Program  
    Replace strings of blanks with **minimum tabs and spaces** to maintain spacing.  
    Decide which to prefer when a single tab or blank suffices.

22. **Exercise 1-22:** Fold Long Lines  
    Fold input lines into **shorter lines** at the last non-blank before column `n`. Handle very long lines without spaces/tabs carefully.

23. **Exercise 1-23:** Remove C Comments  
    Write a program to **remove all comments** from a C program.  
    ⚠️ Handle quoted strings and character constants. Remember: C comments don’t nest.

24. **Exercise 1-24:** Syntax Checker  
    Check a C program for **rudimentary syntax errors**: unmatched parentheses, brackets, and braces.  
    ⚠️ Account for quotes, escape sequences, and comments.
